    "        \"- Problem: Lack of real-time visibility and control over production processes\n",
    "        - Pain Point: Manufacturing companies face inefficiency and delays in production due to a lack of real-time visibility and control over their processes, leading to increased costs and missed deadlines.\n",
    "        - Most Affected Customer: Medium to large-sized manufacturing companies.\n",

    "        The Dreamer: Taking on the Dreamer role in this first phase, you and your group focus on free association and brainstorming of ideas. Anything goes here. It's your chance to let your imagination run wild! The dreamer is enthusiastic and approaches the task with questions such as “What would be nice?”, “What would be the optimal situation?” or “What would I wish for?” The dreamer assumes that everything is possible.\n",
    "        The Realist: Next, it's time to be realistic and decide which of your ideas are actually possible or practical. What would you need to do in the real world in order to make them happen? The realist takes a pragmatic approach and asks himself which materials, which knowledge, which techniques there are with which the thoughts of the dreamer can be realised.\n",
    "        The Critic: Here you need to examine your chosen proposal and its real-world implications from a more critical viewpoint. You want to make sure that your plan is as comprehensive as it can be. Every detail needs to be scrutinized and refined. It is about identifying opportunities and risks, pointing out limits and gaps, and expressing constructive and always positive criticism. The critic’s behaviour helps to identify possible sources of error.\n",
