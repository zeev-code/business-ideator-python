As factories become increasingly automated, the need for a unified platform that can effectively communicate between different machinery, software, and operational protocols becomes paramount. This problem is exacerbated by the presence of legacy systems that are not inherently designed to interface with modern technologies. The lack of efficient process integration results in reduced operational efficiency, increased downtime, and higher costs due to manual intervention and customized solutions.

As factories become more integrated with IoT devices and smart technologies, the volume of data generated is colossal. However, the process of transforming this raw data into actionable insights is fraught with inefficiencies and is often a tedious, time-consuming task. This transformation involves converting data into a format that is useful for analysis, which is critical for making informed decisions on the factory floor. The automation of this process is still in its nascent stages, and current solutions are either too generic or not sufficiently scalable to handle the specific needs of factory automation systems.
