      "\n",
      "Feasibility: Implementing a real-time production monitoring system within a budget of 100 EUR may be challenging. However, with careful planning and utilizing low-cost or open-source technologies, it could be achievable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "The real-time production monitoring system would involve installing sensors and data collection devices in key areas of the production process to capture real-time data. This data would be transmitted to a central control system that provides visibility and control over the production processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To tailor this solution to the budget, we can consider using low-cost IoT sensors and open-source software for data collection and analysis. These sensors would be strategically placed in production lines, machines, and other relevant areas to capture data on factors such as machine performance, cycle times, production output, and energy consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "The collected data would be transmitted wirelessly to a central control system. The control system would process the data, provide real-time visibility into the production processes, and trigger alerts or notifications in case of any deviations or issues. This would enable manufacturers to proactively address inefficiencies and delays, leading to improved productivity and reduced costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspiration:\n",
      "The idea of real-time production monitoring is inspired by the pain point of a lack of real-time visibility and control over production processes, as mentioned in the problem statement. The focus on leveraging low-cost IoT sensors and open-source software is driven by the guiding principle of prioritizing quick, low-investment idea testing and aiming for large profits with smaller budgets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feasibility Rating: 2 (Moderate)\n",
      "Explanation: While implementing a real-time production monitoring system with a budget of 100 EUR may be challenging, it is still feasible by utilizing low-cost or open-source technologies. The impact on addressing production inefficiencies would be significant, as real-time visibility and control would enable manufacturers to identify and address issues promptly.\n",
