      "From the given text, one of the problems that seem to stand out across different sectors – be it hospitality, manufacturing, solar energy, or data management – is the need for advanced automation and digital transformation to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer or user experiences. Taking the perspective of a customer in the manufacturing sector, particularly interested in integrating advanced automation solutions like those offered by Software Defined Automation, the mom-test questions might be answered as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Why do you want that?**\n",
      "We're facing significant challenges with our current factory automation systems, which are inflexible and unable to keep up with the rapidly changing market demands for customized products. The proprietary nature of our existing systems also makes it difficult and costly to upgrade or integrate new technologies. Implementing a solution like Industrial-Control-as-a-Service (ICaaS) would allow us to manage our PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) more efficiently and adapt more quickly to market demands without significant downtime or investment in new hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. What would that empower you to do?**\n",
      "Adopting an advanced automation solution would enable us to dramatically increase our production flexibility and efficiency. We could more easily customize our products to meet specific customer demands, respond faster to changes in the market, and potentially even reduce our production costs by optimizing our operations. Essentially, it would give us the agility we need to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. How are you managing without it?**\n",
      "Currently, we're managing with a patchwork of solutions and manual interventions, which is far from ideal. It's time-consuming, error-prone, and limits our ability to scale or adapt quickly. We often have to make compromises on the level of customization we can offer or face longer lead times, which impacts our competitiveness and customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. How would that fit into your day?**\n",
      "Implementing a cloud-based automation solution would seamlessly fit into our operations. It would allow our engineers and production managers to focus more on innovation and less on troubleshooting or manual programming tasks. The ability to manage and version PLC code collaboratively could also enhance our team's productivity and collaboration, making our daily operations more efficient and less frustrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Do you think we should push back the launch to add the feature, or is it something we could include at a later date?**\n",
      "Given the competitive pressures and the clear benefits, I believe it would be worthwhile to prioritize the integration of advanced automation features at launch. Delaying these capabilities could put us at a disadvantage in the market. However, if there are significant technical challenges, an iterative approach where basic functionalities are launched first, followed by more advanced features, could be a practical compromise.\n",
